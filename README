Problem1:

run:

./ngram.py [an integer n that is the length of the ngrams] [an integer s that is the length of the slide] [the name of the file to analyze] [the name of the output file]

Output:

The output will be a file with the n-grams in hex and the number of occurrence in the file.

In my testing, the longest time to run the program is 0.08s.
